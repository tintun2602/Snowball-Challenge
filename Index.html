   <h2>Our Aim</h2>
   <p> Democracy for all is a non profit organization with the sole purpose of helping and introducing democratic changes such as free press, voting system and learning the citizens about democracy for growing the country economically and will help with poverty.  </p>
   <h2> Why is democracy important?</h2> 
   <p>Winston Churchill once famously said, ‘democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.’ Although it’s not perfect,, democracy aims to bring the most benefits to the most number of people. These include:
       <ul>
           <li>Through direct democracy. Everyone gets the chance to vote on the outcome of a decision. An example is the Brexit referendum in 2016. </li>
           <li>Through representative democracy. People vote to elect officials to make decisions to reflect the wishes of the people, such as the US Congress and UK Parliament.</li>
       </ul>
